# Whee store front

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project was created to test my technical skills with a stack I've recently learned. The project is currently purely frontend with no backend implementation.

The application is a storefront which has a list of products that can be added to the basket. The basket can then be edited (item quantities can be updated or removed entirely). The checkout button currently has no functionality.

The application has been developed with and tested on mac using the following browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari

## Tech Stack
- React 
- Typescript
- Sass
- Jest

## Requirements 
- node (created with node v18.10.0)
- npm  (created with npm v8.19.2)

## Installation Instructions
Clone the repo, then install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To run the project (at http://localhost:3000 by default), run:
```
npm install
```

To run and watch tests, run:
```
npm test
```
